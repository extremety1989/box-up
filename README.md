To run the game you need a VR.
When you enter the game you have a Menu to the right. You can adjust floor position by holding eather left or right trigger button when you click the button "Adjust floor position" then a white floor appears where you just need to touch your real floor and release trigger button. 


Do not use Menu button on left controller when you want to exit navigator, just use Occulus button on the right controller.
